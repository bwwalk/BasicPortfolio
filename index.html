        I worked as a Cloud Architect for General Electric for 16 years. I recently accepted a voluntary job seperation package and left GE on June 28th. I have accepted a new position with Docker. I start my new role as a Solution Architect on August 29th.

        I recently moved to North Carolina from Madison Wisconsin. So far, I enjoy the area but still working to feel completely comfortable. We are currently living in a rental house in Durham while our new home is being built in Hillsborough, NC. Our move-in date will be September 14th.

        I have one daughter that lives in Minneapolis Minnesota. She just completed her Masters degree in Marketing and works as a marketing manager. Our kids that live with us are two black labs names Rylie and Millie. Rylie is ten years old and Millie is just over one year old.
